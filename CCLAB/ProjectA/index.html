  <p>Save Private Morty is an interactive level game which serves as a campaign to fight against the virus. As users enter the game world, they can see Morty was in a coma. Act as Rick, we need to kill all the viruses inside Morty’s body. There will be instructions on the screen, as the users follow the instructions they will go into the second level. The second level is an educational epidemic prevention quiz Once the users get all the questions right, they will enter the last level—killing the virus.In the last level, there will be virus all over the screen,for new virus you just need one click to kill them,however, if you did not kill the virus in time, the virus will be harder to kill,users need to double click. Meanwhile, the older virus’s shape will be larger and color will be deeper to show the difference and its horror. If you accidentally click on the bomb, the whole game will end. I used many metaphors in this game. So for the virus to be harder to kill if time passes by, I want to illustrate that whenever there is sickness, it is important to cure it in time or it will be harder to cure. The bomb means the hidden danger inside our body, it looks fine in normal life, but once we triggar it, it will brought unaffordable cost. Mainly, under the rampant spread of covid, I desire everyone to protect themselves from being infected.</p>
