          Plastic waste makes up 80% of all marine pollution and around 8 to 10 million metric tons of plastic end up in the ocean each year.
Research states that, by 2050, plastic will likely outweigh all fish in the sea.
In the last ten years, we have produced more plastic products than in the previous century.
The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has stated that basically 100% of all plastics human beings have ever created are still in existence.
Plastic generally takes between 500-1000 years to degrade. Even then, it becomes microplastics, without fully degrading.
